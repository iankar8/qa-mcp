# 🧪 QA MCP Extension - Complete Demo

This demonstrates the comprehensive QA capabilities you requested:
- **a) Check if localhost is working**
- **b) If not working: Send console logs back to app**
- **c) If working: QA the product to find issues and problems**

## 🎯 **Two-Stage QA Workflow**

### **Stage 1: Localhost Health Check** 
If localhost fails to start or respond, the system will:

#### **Scenario A: Server Not Running (ECONNREFUSED)**
```bash
User: "QA test my localhost"

QA Engineer: 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED
❌ Localhost health check FAILED: http://localhost:3000 - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000

🔍 DIAGNOSIS:
- Connectivity: failed
- Issue: Connection refused - server not running
- Root Cause: Development server is not started

🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Start the development server: npm run dev
2. Check if port 3000 is correct
3. Verify server is binding to correct interface

💡 RECOMMENDED COMMAND: cd /Users/iankar/promptsupply/prompt-supply && npm run dev
```

#### **Scenario B: Server Running but Returning Errors (500, 404)**
```bash
QA Engineer: ⚠️ MAJOR ISSUE DETECTED
❌ Health check FAILED: http://localhost:3000 returned HTTP 500 in 1247ms

🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS:
- Server Response: HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)
- Response Time: 1247ms (acceptable)
- Content Analysis: Error content detected in response
- Error Indicators: "TypeError: Cannot read property", "Database connection failed"

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:
1. Check server logs for detailed error traces
2. Verify database connectivity (Supabase connection)
3. Review environment variables (.env.local)
4. Restart development server to clear cached errors

📋 CONSOLE LOGS CAPTURED:
[ERROR] TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined
[ERROR] Supabase connection failed: Invalid API key
[WARN] Missing environment variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
```

### **Stage 2: Comprehensive QA Testing**
If localhost is working, the system runs comprehensive QA:

#### **Example: Full QA Report for prompt-supply App**
```bash
User: "My localhost is working - QA test it thoroughly"

QA Engineer: ✅ Localhost connectivity verified - Starting comprehensive QA testing...

🧪 RUNNING QA TEST SUITE:
✅ Framework Detection: Next.js with Supabase integration
✅ Health Check: localhost:3000 (127ms response time)
✅ Console Monitoring: Running 30-second error detection
✅ Functional Testing: Forms, navigation, responsive design
✅ Screenshot Analysis: Homepage, dashboard, AI studio pages

📊 QA RESULTS SUMMARY:
- Total Tests: 15
- Passed: 12 ✅
- Failed: 3 ❌
- Critical Issues: 1 🚨
- Major Issues: 2 ⚠️  
- Minor Issues: 4 📝

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately):
1. JavaScript Error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null"
   - Location: /api/ai/chat route
   - Impact: Chat functionality completely broken
   - Fix: Add null check before accessing user.id

⚠️ MAJOR ISSUES (High Priority):
1. Form Validation Broken: Contact form accepts invalid emails
   - Location: /auth/signup page
   - Impact: Users can create accounts with invalid data
   - Fix: Add proper email validation to signup form

2. Navigation Error: Broken link to /pricing page
   - Status: HTTP 404
   - Impact: Users cannot access pricing information
   - Fix: Create pricing page or update navigation links

📝 MINOR ISSUES (Nice to Fix):
1. Missing alt text on 3 images (Accessibility)
2. Page title missing on /dashboard (SEO)
3. Slow response on /api/ai/analyze (2.1s - should be <1s)
4. Form labels missing for better accessibility

📸 VISUAL EVIDENCE:
- homepage-screenshot.png: UI rendering correctly ✅
- dashboard-screenshot.png: Layout good, missing loading states ⚠️
- signup-form-screenshot.png: Form validation issues visible ❌

📋 CONSOLE MONITORING RESULTS:
- JavaScript Errors: 1 critical
- Network Errors: 0
- Performance Warnings: 2
- Security Issues: 0
- Accessibility Violations: 4

🎯 PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. URGENT: Fix chat functionality JavaScript error
2. HIGH: Implement proper form validation
3. MEDIUM: Add missing pages and fix navigation
4. LOW: Improve accessibility and performance
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Tool Usage Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Health Check with Enhanced Diagnostics
health_check({
  url: "http://localhost:3000",
  timeout: 10000,
  expectedStatus: 200
})

// 2. If healthy, run Console Monitoring
console_monitor({
  url: "http://localhost:3000",
  duration: 30000,
  filters: {
    errors: true,
    warnings: true,
    network: true,
    security: true
  },
  interactions: [
    { action: "click", selector: "#chat-button" },
    { action: "type", selector: "#message-input", value: "test message" },
    { action: "click", selector: "#send-button" }
  ]
})

// 3. Run Comprehensive Functional QA
functional_qa({
  url: "http://localhost:3000", 
  testSuite: "comprehensive",
  userFlows: [
    {
      name: "User Signup Flow",
      steps: [
        { action: "goto", value: "http://localhost:3000/auth/signup" },
        { action: "type", selector: "#email", value: "test@example.com" },
        { action: "type", selector: "#password", value: "password123" },
        { action: "click", selector: "#signup-button" },
        { action: "verify", selector: "#success-message", expected: "Account created" }
      ]
    }
  ]
})

// 4. Generate Comprehensive Report
generate_test_report({
  testResults: {
    framework: "Next.js",
    qaMetrics: { totalTests: 15, passed: 12, failed: 3, criticalIssues: 1 },
    issues: [...allIssues],
    consoleMonitoring: {...consoleResults},
    functionalQA: {...qaResults}
  },
  outputFormat: "html"
})
```

### **Smart Error Categorization:**
```javascript
// The system automatically categorizes issues:
{
  severity: "critical",    // Breaks core functionality
  category: "JavaScript",  // Error type
  issue: "TypeError in chat function",
  recommendation: "Add null checks to prevent runtime errors",
  details: { 
    stackTrace: "...",
    affectedFeature: "AI Chat",
    reproducible: true
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **For Broken Applications:**
```bash
"My localhost isn't working"
"Getting ECONNREFUSED errors"  
"Server returns 500 errors"
"Database connection failing"
```
